Click on any two cards with your mouse pointer, and they will turn over. If they aren't a match, they will shake and turn red. If they are a match, they'll pulsate and turn green. Try and find all 8 matching pairs as quickly as you can! 

If you want to start again, you can at any point, by clicking the reset button (![Reset button image](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tomastephenson/Udacity-Assignment-2-Matching-Game/master/img/reset.png){:height="700px" width="400px"}
) on the top-right of the board.

## Star Rating
Each set of two cards that you click count as one move. The ratings are calculated as follows:

* 3 stars - Find all 8 matches in just 10 moves or less (VERY difficult!)
* 2 stars - Find all 8 matches in 20 moves or less
* 1 star - Find all 8 matches in 30 moves or less
